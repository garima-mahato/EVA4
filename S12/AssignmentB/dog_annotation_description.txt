Description of Annotation JSON file
-----------------------------------

1) The annotation file is in JSON format where the number of items is equal to the number of images annotated.
2) Each item of the JSON, which corresponds to each image, is a key-value pair where key is the unique id given to the corresponding image's annotation and value is its annotation details.

Below is the example of each item:

"dog1.jpg129986": {
    "filename": "dog1.jpg",
    "size": 129986,
    "regions": [
      {
        "shape_attributes": {
          "name": "rect",
          "x": 626,
          "y": 144,
          "width": 502,
          "height": 618
        },
        "region_attributes": {
          "class": "dog"
        }
      }
    ],
    "file_attributes": {
      "image_width": "1280",
      "image_height": "853"
    }
  }

"dog1.jpg129986" is the key for this image's annotation entry. This unique id is formed by combining file name and file size of image.
The value of this entry is "dog1" image's annotation details which is a dictionary.

3) The value dictionary of single image item contains:
	a) filename - This stores the name of the image file as string. In this example, since the file's name was "dog1.jpg", it got stored here.
	b) size - This stores size of the image in bytes as integer. The file size of "dog1.jpg" was 129986 bytes.
	c) regions - This is a list/array of all the bounding boxes annotated within that single image.
		* Each item in this list corresponds to 1 boundary box which is a dictionary. This dictionary consists of key-value pair denoting:
			i) shape_attributes - It is a dictionary containing details about 
			ii) region_attributes - 
	d) file_attributes - This is a dictionary of all the variables defined as file attributes during annotation. The key-value pair in this dictionary is defined by the user. Here, I stored "image_width" denoting the image's width and "image_height" denoting the image's height. In this example, image height is 853px and width is 1280px.
