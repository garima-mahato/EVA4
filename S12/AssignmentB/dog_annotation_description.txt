Description of Annotation JSON file
-----------------------------------

1) The annotation file is in JSON format where the number of items is equal to the number of images annotated.
2) Each item of the JSON, which corresponds to each image, is a key-value pair where key is the unique id given to the corresponding image's annotation and value is its annotation details.

Below is the example of each item:

"dog1.jpg129986": {
    "filename": "dog1.jpg",
    "size": 129986,
    "regions": [
      {
        "shape_attributes": {
          "name": "rect",
          "x": 626,
          "y": 144,
          "width": 502,
          "height": 618
        },
        "region_attributes": {
          "class": "dog"
        }
      }
    ],
    "file_attributes": {
      "image_width": "1280",
      "image_height": "853"
    }
  }

3) "dog1.jpg129986" is the key for this image's annotation entry. This unique id is formed by combining file name and file size of image.
The value of this entry is "dog1" image's annotation details which is a dictionary.

4) The value dictionary of single image item contains:
	a) filename - This stores the name of the image file as string. In this example, since the file's name was "dog1.jpg", it got stored here.
	b) size - This stores size of the image in bytes as integer. The file size of "dog1.jpg" was 129986 bytes.
	c) regions - This is a list/array of all the bounding boxes annotated within that single image.
		* Each item in this list corresponds to 1 boundary box which is a dictionary. This dictionary consists of key-value pair denoting:
			i) shape_attributes - It is a dictionary containing details about the shape used to draw the bounding box. It consists of following details:
				* name - denoting name of the shape used. In this example, since a rectangle was used to draw the bounding box, "rect" is stored.
				* x - denoting bottom-left x index of bounding box from origin. In this example, bounding box left-bottom was at 626px on X-axis.
				* y - denoting bottom-left y index of bounding box from origin. In this example, bounding box left-bottom was at 144px on Y-axis.
				* width - denoting width bounding box. In this example, bounding box width was at 502px.
				* height - denoting height of bounding box. In this example, bounding box height was at 618px.
			ii) region_attributes - It is a dictionary containing user-defined variables about the boundary box where key denotes variable name and value denotes its variable's value. In this example, bounding box depicts a dog. So, I created a "class" variable with value as "dog".
	d) file_attributes - This is a dictionary of all the variables defined as file attributes during annotation. The key-value pair in this dictionary is defined by the user. Here, I stored "image_width" denoting the image's width and "image_height" denoting the image's height. In this example, image height is 853px and width is 1280px.
